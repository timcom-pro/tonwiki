**Mechanics of basic processes**:
The author (any user) proposes a topic for a new article (or an update for an existing one) in his/her language section (or chooses from the suggested topics), writes the text and sends a draft for review. After edits and approval by the Editors, the Author uploads the text to the Wiki himself. 

The Translator selects an article to translate from among those approved by the Editors, after which the translation is checked by the native Editor (if available) and the Editors for the percentage of machine translation, after which the Translator uploads the text to the Wiki.

At the end of the reporting period, Authors, Translators and Editors submit requests for rewards, indicating the amount of work done and the requested remuneration according to the current rates.

Each submission is evaluated by a decentralized Jury, which is selected on a regular basis from among active community members based on their applications. Based on the results of the review, the Author/Translator/Editor receives full or partial payment for the completed work.

**How can authors and translators learn to use the MediaWiki engine?**
The MediaWiki engine is one of the most popular. There is a detailed [manual]9https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Editing_pages) for authors. In addition, there will be a guide in the Wiki Telegram channel. 

**Maximum number of texts that an author (translator) can take on at one time**: 3

**Jury Work**:
The Jury (members) is an independent team (8-12 people), recruited once every 3 months by the current members of the Jury (originally, the Initial Team), which evaluates the content with an independent eye. 

During the Voting period, the Jury evaluates the submissions for rewards, giving scores from 1 to 10 for each submission. As a result of the voting, an average score is derived and the payout is adjusted.

Example:
Average score of 10.0 – the Author received 100% of the requested rewards. 
Average score of 7.0 – the Author received 70% of the requested rewards.

Any member of the community whose application is approved by the current Jury can become a Jury member (voting is conducted by on-chain SMV method, e.g. using [TON.VOTE](https://ton.vote/) service).

There is a rotation of Jury members. Rewards are also provided for the Jury. The Jury deliberates in a private Telegram chat.

**Voting Period**:
From the 1st to the 10th day of the calendar month for the previous calendar month. In this period, the Jury votes on submissions and rewards are transferred.

**Signing transactions by members**:
Preferably, through the multisig
